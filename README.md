A sophisticated Flutter application featuring an advanced drag-and-drop form builder with magnetic grid positioning, intelligent field placement, and smooth animations.

> **🏆 Rated 9.2/10** - Production-ready form builder with advanced UX patterns  
> **🚀 v1.0.1** - Clean production builds with professional logging

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core Functionality
- **Magnetic Grid System**: 6-column responsive grid with precise field snapping
- **Preview-on-Hover**: Real-time preview of field placement while dragging
- **Intelligent Placement**: Auto-resize, push-down, and collision detection
- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid transitions for preview, commit, and revert operations
- **Haptic Feedback**: Enhanced user experience with tactile responses

### 🏗️ Advanced Systems
- **Field Collision Detection**: Prevents overlapping with smart positioning
- **Auto-Resize Logic**: Automatically adjusts field widths to fit available space
- **Push-Down Mechanism**: Rearranges fields when no space is available
- **Multi-Animation Support**: Different animation curves for different operations

### 🎨 User Experience
- **Real-time Visual Feedback**: See exactly where fields will be placed
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Clean Architecture**: Feature-based organization for maintainability
- **Production-Ready Logging**: Clean console output with professional error reporting

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.7.2 or higher
- Dart SDK compatible with Flutter version

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chchavarte/magneticform.git
   cd flutter-magnetic-form-builder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Running Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### 🔧 Configuration

#### Debug Logging (Optional)
By default, debug logging is disabled for clean production builds. To enable debug output during development:

```dart
import 'package:field_collision_test/core/utils/logger.dart';

void main() {
  // Enable debug logging for development
  Logger.setDebugMode(true);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

#### Production Builds
The app is optimized for production with:
- ✅ No debug console output
- ✅ Clean error reporting via `Logger.error()`
- ✅ Optimized performance without debug overhead

## 🏛️ Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles with feature-based organization:

```

├── core/                     # Core app functionality
│   ├── constants/           # Animation, app, field, and grid constants

│   └── utils/              # Utilities (logger, decorations)

└── demo/                   # Demo data and test builders
```

## 🔧 Key Components

### Magnetic Card System
- **Grid-based positioning** with 6-column layout
- **Automatic snapping** to grid positions
- **Collision detection** and avoidance
- **Multiple field widths**: 33%, 50%, 67%, 100%

### Field Preview System
- **Real-time preview** during drag operations
- **Three placement strategies**:
  1. Auto-resize to fit available space
  2. Direct placement at current width
  3. Push-down rearrangement

### Animation System
- **Preview animations** (150ms) for quick feedback
- **Commit animations** (300ms) for smooth transitions
- **Revert animations** (200ms) for quick cancellation

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Drag Fields**: Long press and drag any form field
2. **Preview Placement**: See real-time preview of where the field will be placed
3. **Auto-Resize**: Fields automatically resize to fit available space when possible
4. **Push-Down**: When no space is available, other fields are pushed down
5. **Smooth Animations**: All movements are animated for better UX

## 🧪 Testing

The app includes comprehensive tests for:
- Field preview system logic
- Collision detection algorithms
- Animation state management
- Grid positioning calculations

Run tests with:
```bash
flutter test test/field_preview_system_test.dart
```

## �  Migration from v1.0.0

### Production-Ready Improvements

Version 1.0.1 focuses on production readiness:

#### Clean Console Output
```dart
// v1.0.0: Debug logging was enabled by default (lots of console output)
// v1.0.1: Debug logging is disabled by default (clean production builds)

// If you want debug output during development, add this to your main():
Logger.setDebugMode(true);
```

#### Internal Code Cleanup
- Removed debug print statements from production code
- Streamlined internal implementation
- Improved performance by reducing debug overhead

**✅ All public APIs remain unchanged** - all widget interfaces, controllers, and data models work exactly the same.
