- ✅ MagneticSystem provides unified grid and animation services

### 2. Data Flow Integration
- ✅ Form data changes propagate correctly through callbacks
- ✅ Field configurations persist and restore properly
- ✅ State management works across all interaction types

### 3. User Experience Preservation
- ✅ All user interactions work identically to original implementation
- ✅ Drag and drop functionality preserved
- ✅ Resize operations maintain original behavior
- ✅ Auto-expand logic works as expected

### 4. Performance Characteristics
- ✅ Animation durations match original specifications
- ✅ No performance degradation during rapid interactions
- ✅ Memory usage patterns maintained

### 5. API Compatibility

- ✅ Constructor parameters work without changes
- ✅ Callback functions receive identical data structures
- ✅ Field models serialize/deserialize correctly

## Test Results

**Total Tests**: 27 integration tests + 63 existing tests = 90 tests
**Passed**: 90/90 (100%)
**Failed**: 0/90 (0%)
**Coverage**: All consolidated components and their interactions

## Requirements Validation
