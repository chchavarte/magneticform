# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves transforming the existing Flutter Magnetic Form Builder from an app-specific implementation into a highly reusable Flutter package that can be distributed on pub.dev. The goal is to increase reusability from 7.5/10 to 9.5/10 by creating a generic, extensible, and themeable form builder with magnetic grid positioning capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to use a reusable magnetic form builder package, so that I can quickly integrate drag-and-drop form building capabilities into my applications without writing custom implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer adds the package to their pubspec.yaml THEN the system SHALL provide access to all core form builder functionality
2. WHEN a developer imports the package THEN the system SHALL expose a clean public API with minimal required parameters
3. WHEN a developer uses the basic MagneticFormBuilder widget THEN the system SHALL render a functional form builder with default configuration
4. IF a developer provides no configuration THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for grid layout, theming, and field types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to customize the grid system configuration, so that I can adapt the form builder to different screen sizes and layout requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer provides MagneticGridConfig THEN the system SHALL apply custom column count, row height, and allowed field widths
2. WHEN a developer specifies animation settings THEN the system SHALL use custom duration and curve for field positioning animations
3. WHEN a developer sets field padding THEN the system SHALL apply consistent spacing between form fields
4. IF no grid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use default 6-column grid with standard dimensions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to customize the visual appearance of the form builder, so that it matches my application's design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer provides MagneticFormTheme THEN the system SHALL apply custom colors, text styles, and decorations
2. WHEN a developer specifies grid line colors THEN the system SHALL render the grid with the provided styling
3. WHEN a developer sets preview and drag colors THEN the system SHALL use these colors during field positioning
4. WHEN a developer provides field decorations THEN the system SHALL apply consistent styling to all form fields

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to use built-in field types, so that I can quickly create forms with common input elements without implementing custom fields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer uses the package THEN the system SHALL provide standard field types including text, email, number, date, dropdown, checkbox, and radio
2. WHEN a developer adds a field type to availableFields THEN the system SHALL render it in the field palette
3. WHEN a developer drags a field from the palette THEN the system SHALL create a configured instance on the grid
4. WHEN a developer configures field properties THEN the system SHALL update the field's behavior and appearance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to create custom field types, so that I can extend the form builder with application-specific input elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer extends MagneticField abstract class THEN the system SHALL accept the custom field type
2. WHEN a developer registers a custom field with FieldRegistry THEN the system SHALL make it available for use
3. WHEN a developer implements required methods THEN the system SHALL render and manage the custom field like built-in types
4. WHEN a developer provides configurable properties THEN the system SHALL expose them in the field configuration interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to control form builder state programmatically, so that I can save, load, and manipulate form configurations from my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer provides FormBuilderController THEN the system SHALL use it for state management
2. WHEN a developer calls controller methods THEN the system SHALL add, remove, or update fields accordingly
3. WHEN a developer calls toJson() THEN the system SHALL return serializable form configuration
4. WHEN a developer calls fromJson() THEN the system SHALL restore form state from serialized data
5. WHEN form state changes THEN the system SHALL notify listeners through ChangeNotifier

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to receive callbacks for form events, so that I can respond to user interactions and form changes in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fields are added, removed, or repositioned THEN the system SHALL call onFieldsChanged callback with current configuration
2. WHEN a field's properties are modified THEN the system SHALL call onFieldConfigured callback with field details
3. WHEN callbacks are provided THEN the system SHALL pass relevant data including field IDs and configurations
4. IF no callbacks are provided THEN the system SHALL continue to function without errors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want validation capabilities for form fields, so that I can ensure data quality and provide user feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer adds validation rules to fields THEN the system SHALL validate input according to the rules
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
3. WHEN a developer implements custom validators THEN the system SHALL use them for field validation
4. WHEN form is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate all fields and prevent submission if errors exist

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want conditional field logic, so that I can create dynamic forms that show/hide fields based on user input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer defines conditional rules THEN the system SHALL monitor trigger field values
2. WHEN trigger conditions are met THEN the system SHALL execute specified actions (show, hide, enable, disable, setValue)
3. WHEN field visibility changes THEN the system SHALL animate transitions smoothly
4. WHEN conditional logic creates circular dependencies THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to generate actual forms from builder configuration, so that I can use the designed forms for data collection in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls FormGenerator.generateForm() THEN the system SHALL create a functional form widget from configuration
2. WHEN generated form is rendered THEN the system SHALL display all configured fields with proper layout and styling
3. WHEN users interact with generated form THEN the system SHALL collect and validate input data
4. WHEN form is submitted THEN the system SHALL return structured data matching the field configuration

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want comprehensive testing and documentation, so that developers can confidently use the package and contribute to its development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package is built THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all core functionality
2. WHEN package is published THEN the system SHALL include widget tests for UI components
3. WHEN developers access documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear API documentation with examples
4. WHEN developers view the example app THEN the system SHALL demonstrate all major features and use cases

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to install the package from pub.dev, so that I can easily add it to my project using standard Flutter package management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package is published to pub.dev THEN the system SHALL be installable via flutter pub add command
2. WHEN package is installed THEN the system SHALL have minimal dependencies and no conflicts with common Flutter packages
3. WHEN package is imported THEN the system SHALL provide all functionality through a single import statement
4. WHEN package is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for major API features
