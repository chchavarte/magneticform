# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves cleaning up all debug and print statements from the Flutter codebase to prepare it for production. The codebase currently contains various debug print statements and Logger calls that were used during development but should be removed or properly configured for production use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all debug print statements removed from the codebase, so that the production app doesn't output unnecessary debug information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is scanned THEN all `print()` statements used for debugging SHALL be removed
2. WHEN field2 debug statements are found THEN they SHALL be completely removed
3. WHEN auto-expand debug statements are found THEN they SHALL be completely removed
4. WHEN long press debug statements are found THEN they SHALL be completely removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Logger debug calls to be properly configured, so that they can be controlled via debug mode settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Logger.debug() calls are found THEN they SHALL be reviewed and kept only if necessary
2. WHEN Logger.preview() calls are found THEN they SHALL be reviewed and kept only if necessary
3. WHEN Logger.resize() calls are found THEN they SHALL be reviewed and kept only if necessary
4. WHEN Logger.info() calls are found THEN they SHALL be reviewed and kept only if necessary
5. WHEN Logger.success() calls are found THEN they SHALL be reviewed and kept only if necessary

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Logger debug mode to be disabled by default in production, so that debug logs don't appear in production builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Logger class is configured THEN debug mode SHALL be disabled by default
2. WHEN in production builds THEN debug logs SHALL not be output
3. WHEN Logger.error() is called THEN it SHALL still work in production for error reporting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want debug comments to be cleaned up, so that the code is production-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug comments are found THEN they SHALL be removed or converted to proper documentation
2. WHEN temporary debug code blocks are found THEN they SHALL be removed
3. WHEN debug-related imports are no longer needed THEN they SHALL be removed
