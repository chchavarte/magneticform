# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves transforming the existing Flutter magnetic form builder from an application-specific implementation into a highly reusable package suitable for distribution on pub.dev. The current codebase is tightly coupled to the specific application and lacks the abstraction, configurability, and public API design needed for broad reusability. The goal is to create a generic, extensible, and themeable package that developers can easily integrate into their own Flutter applications while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Package Structure and Public API

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to install and use the magnetic form builder as a standard pub.dev package, so that I can quickly integrate drag-and-drop form building capabilities into my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating package structure THEN the system SHALL organize code into lib/src/ with a main export file at lib/magnetic_form_builder.dart
2. WHEN defining public API THEN the system SHALL expose only essential classes and widgets through the main export file
3. WHEN creating package configuration THEN the system SHALL provide proper pubspec.yaml with dependencies, version, and metadata
4. WHEN implementing main widget THEN the system SHALL create MagneticFormBuilder widget with clean, intuitive API
5. WHEN providing examples THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive example app demonstrating all features
6. WHEN documenting API THEN the system SHALL provide complete dartdoc comments for all public interfaces

### Requirement 2: Generic Field System

**User Story:** As a developer using the package, I want to register custom field types and extend the available field widgets, so that I can create forms with application-specific field components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining field abstraction THEN the system SHALL create abstract MagneticField class with standard interface
2. WHEN implementing field registry THEN the system SHALL allow runtime registration of custom field types
3. WHEN creating built-in fields THEN the system SHALL provide standard field types (text, email, number, date, dropdown, checkbox, radio)
4. WHEN defining field properties THEN the system SHALL support configurable properties for each field type
5. WHEN implementing field categories THEN the system SHALL organize fields into logical categories (input, selection, date, media, layout)
6. WHEN building fields THEN the system SHALL support custom field builders and rendering overrides

### Requirement 3: Configurable Grid and Layout System

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the package, I want to customize the grid layout, column count, and positioning behavior, so that the form builder fits my application's design requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring grid THEN the system SHALL support customizable column count, row height, and field spacing
2. WHEN defining grid behavior THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of allowed field widths and snap positions
3. WHEN implementing animations THEN the system SHALL support configurable animation duration and curves
4. WHEN handling responsive design THEN the system SHALL adapt grid layout to different screen sizes
5. WHEN positioning fields THEN the system SHALL maintain magnetic snapping behavior with configurable sensitivity
6. WHEN managing layout THEN the system SHALL support different layout modes (fixed grid, flexible, responsive)

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Theming System

**User Story:** As a developer using the package, I want to customize colors, typography, and visual styling to match my application's design system, so that the form builder integrates seamlessly with my app's appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing theme system THEN the system SHALL create MagneticFormTheme extending ThemeExtension
2. WHEN defining theme properties THEN the system SHALL support customization of colors, typography, decorations, and spacing
3. WHEN applying themes THEN the system SHALL integrate with Flutter's theme system and support light/dark modes
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL allow per-component theme overrides
5. WHEN providing defaults THEN the system SHALL include sensible default theme that works without customization
6. WHEN supporting inheritance THEN the system SHALL properly inherit and merge theme properties

### Requirement 5: Controller Pattern and State Management

**User Story:** As a developer using the package, I want programmatic control over form configuration and field management, so that I can integrate the form builder with my application's state management and business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing controller THEN the system SHALL create FormBuilderController for programmatic field management
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL support adding, removing, and updating fields programmatically
3. WHEN handling persistence THEN the system SHALL provide serialization methods for saving/loading form configurations
4. WHEN notifying changes THEN the system SHALL use ChangeNotifier pattern for reactive state updates
5. WHEN validating forms THEN the system SHALL support form validation and error handling
6. WHEN generating forms THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to generate actual forms from builder configuration

### Requirement 6: Advanced Features and Extensibility

**User Story:** As an advanced user of the package, I want conditional field logic, validation rules, and form generation capabilities, so that I can create sophisticated dynamic forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing validation THEN the system SHALL support field-level validation rules and error display
2. WHEN creating conditional logic THEN the system SHALL support show/hide fields based on other field values
3. WHEN generating forms THEN the system SHALL provide FormGenerator to create actual forms from configurations
4. WHEN handling events THEN the system SHALL support comprehensive callback system for field interactions
5. WHEN enabling accessibility THEN the system SHALL ensure all components are accessible and screen reader compatible
6. WHEN supporting internationalization THEN the system SHALL provide i18n support for built-in text and labels

### Requirement 7: Package Distribution and Documentation

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer discovering this package, I want comprehensive documentation, examples, and easy installation, so that I can quickly understand and implement the form builder in my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for pub.dev THEN the system SHALL meet all pub.dev package requirements and scoring criteria
2. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive README with usage examples and API reference
3. WHEN providing examples THEN the system SHALL include multiple example implementations showing different use cases
4. WHEN ensuring quality THEN the system SHALL achieve high pub.dev score with proper testing, documentation, and code quality
5. WHEN supporting developers THEN the system SHALL provide migration guide from application-specific to package usage
6. WHEN maintaining package THEN the system SHALL follow semantic versioning and provide clear changelog

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As the current application maintainer, I want to migrate from the current implementation to the package version without breaking existing functionality, so that I can benefit from the improved architecture while maintaining stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing code THEN the system SHALL provide migration utilities and documentation
2. WHEN preserving functionality THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% feature parity with current implementation
3. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL provide clear mapping from old structure to new package API
4. WHEN handling breaking changes THEN the system SHALL minimize breaking changes and provide deprecation warnings
5. WHEN testing migration THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing tests pass with package version
6. WHEN documenting changes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed migration guide with code examples
