# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves restructuring a Flutter application from a flat file organization to a feature-based architecture following clean architecture principles. The current codebase has files scattered across various directories (lib/constants, lib/utils, lib/widgets) without clear separation of concerns. The goal is to reorganize the code into a structured hierarchy with core utilities, feature-based modules, and proper data/presentation layer separation while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Infrastructure Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want core utilities, themes, and constants organized in a dedicated core module, so that shared functionality is easily accessible and maintainable across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating constants THEN the system SHALL move all files from lib/constants/ to lib/core/constants/ maintaining identical functionality
2. WHEN migrating theme files THEN the system SHALL move lib/app_theme.dart to lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart and extract theme extensions to separate files
3. WHEN migrating core utilities THEN the system SHALL move logger.dart and decoration_utils.dart to lib/core/utils/ while preserving all existing functionality
4. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL update all import statements across the codebase to reference the new file locations
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove empty old directories and unused files

### Requirement 2: Model Layer Restructuring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want model classes properly organized within the feature's data layer, so that data structures are clearly defined and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN splitting form_models.dart THEN the system SHALL extract FieldConfig class to lib/features/customizable_form/data/models/field_config.dart
2. WHEN splitting form_models.dart THEN the system SHALL extract CustomFormField class to lib/features/customizable_form/data/models/form_field.dart
3. WHEN splitting form_models.dart THEN the system SHALL extract MagneticCardSystem class to lib/features/customizable_form/data/models/magnetic_card_system.dart
4. WHEN creating model files THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing class functionality and relationships
5. WHEN creating repository layer THEN the system SHALL implement form_storage_repository.dart for data persistence logic
6. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL update all files that previously imported form_models.dart to use the new individual model files

### Requirement 3: Presentation Layer Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI components, handlers, and systems organized within the feature's presentation layer, so that the user interface code follows clean architecture principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating handlers THEN the system SHALL move resize, drag, and auto-expand handlers to lib/features/customizable_form/presentation/handlers/
2. WHEN migrating systems THEN the system SHALL move field_animations.dart, field_preview_system.dart, and grid_utils.dart to lib/features/customizable_form/presentation/systems/
3. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL move form_ui_builder.dart and field_builders.dart to lib/features/customizable_form/presentation/components/
4. WHEN migrating screens THEN the system SHALL move main form widgets to lib/features/customizable_form/presentation/screens/
5. WHEN organizing presentation layer THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing UI functionality and user interactions
6. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL update all import statements to reference the new presentation layer structure

### Requirement 4: Import Management and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements properly updated and optimized, so that the codebase compiles without errors and follows consistent import patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL use relative imports within the same feature module
2. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL use absolute imports for cross-feature and core dependencies
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL remove all empty directories and obsolete files
4. WHEN creating barrel exports THEN the system SHALL create index files (core.dart, customizable_form.dart) for easier imports
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all files compile without import errors
6. WHEN optimizing imports THEN the system SHALL follow consistent import patterns throughout the codebase

### Requirement 5: Demo and Testing Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want demo files and tests properly organized, so that development and testing workflows are streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing demo files THEN the system SHALL move demo_data.dart and test_field_builder.dart to lib/demo/ directory
2. WHEN updating tests THEN the system SHALL update all test imports to match the new file structure
3. WHEN organizing demo structure THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing demo functionality
4. WHEN updating main.dart THEN the system SHALL update imports to use the new structure while preserving app functionality
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all tests pass with the new structure

### Requirement 6: Functionality Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing application features to work exactly as before, so that the reorganization doesn't break any functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing form building capabilities
2. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all field customization features
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all drag and drop functionality
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all resize and animation behaviors
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all theme and styling functionality
6. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL function identically to the pre-migration state
