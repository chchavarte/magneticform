# Preview-on-Hover System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive preview-on-hover system that shows where fields will be placed when dragging, with support for both direct placement and push-down logic.

## Key Features

### 1. **Preview-on-Hover Logic**
- **Direct Placement**: When space is available in the target row, shows preview in the exact position
- **Push Down**: When no space is available, shows preview with other fields pushed down
- **Visual Feedback**: Different styling for preview states and target indicators

### 2. **Animation Integration**
- Reuses existing `FieldAnimations` system
- Smooth transitions between states:
  - **Preview**: 150ms fast animation to show preview positions
  - **Commit**: 300ms smooth animation to final positions
  - **Revert**: 200ms quick animation back to original positions

### 3. **No Conflict with Resize**
- Preview logic only applies during field drag operations
- Resize operations are completely separate and don't trigger hover logic
- Clean state management prevents interference

## Implementation Details

### Core Files
- `lib/field_preview_system.dart` - Main preview logic and calculations
- `lib/customizable_item_form.dart` - Integration with main form
- `test/field_preview_system_test.dart` - Comprehensive tests

### Key Methods

#### FieldPreviewSystem
- `calculatePreviewPositions()` - Calculates where fields should go (direct or push down)
- `hasSpaceInRow()` - Checks if space is available in target row
- `getPreviewInfo()` - Provides user feedback information
- `animateToPreview/Commit/Revert()` - Animation helpers

#### Form Integration
- `_handlePreviewLogic()` - Main entry point for preview logic
- `_showPreview()` - Shows preview positions with animation
- `_commitPreview()` - Commits preview to final positions
- `_buildPreviewIndicator()` - Visual indicator for target position

### Visual Feedback
- **Preview Fields**: Secondary color border with subtle background
- **Target Indicator**: Dashed border with placement icon
- **Messages**: User-friendly feedback about placement

## Behavior

### When Space Available
1. User drags field over row with space
2. System calculates available position (e.g., columns 3-5)
3. Shows preview with field in target position
4. Other fields remain in place
5. On release, animates to final position

### When No Space Available
1. User drags field over full row
2. System calculates push-down arrangement
3. Shows preview with:
   - Dragged field at start of target row
   - Other fields pushed down to make space
4. On release, commits the rearrangement

### User Experience
- **Immediate Feedback**: Preview shows within 150ms of hover
- **Clear Intent**: Visual indicators show exactly where field will go
- **Smooth Transitions**: All movements are animated
- **Reversible**: Moving away from row reverts preview

## Testing
- 7 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios
- Direct placement, push down, empty rows, and edge cases
- All tests passing with proper overlap detection

## Performance
- Throttled updates (max 100ms intervals) prevent excessive calculations
- Efficient animation reuse
- Minimal state management overhead

## Future Enhancements
- Could add more sophisticated push-down strategies
- Could support horizontal push-aside logic
- Could add preview for multi-row scenarios
