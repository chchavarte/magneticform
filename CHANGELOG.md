# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2025-03-09

### üßπ Improved
- **Production Logging**: Debug logging is now disabled by default for cleaner production builds
- **Console Output**: Removed debug print statements from main application code
- **Performance**: Reduced debug overhead in production builds
- **Error Reporting**: Logger.error() continues to work for proper error tracking

### üîß Changed
- **Logger Default Behavior**: Debug mode is now disabled by default (`_debugMode = false`)
- **Internal Implementation**: Streamlined code by removing debug-specific paths

### üìã Note for Developers
If you need debug output during development, add this to your main():
```dart
Logger.setDebugMode(true);
```

All public APIs remain unchanged - this is a non-breaking improvement.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-03-09

### Added
- **Magnetic Grid System**: 6-column responsive grid with precise field snapping
- **Preview-on-Hover System**: Real-time preview of field placement while dragging
- **Intelligent Field Placement**: 
  - Auto-resize logic to fit available space
  - Direct placement when space is available
  - Push-down mechanism when no space exists
- **Advanced Animation System**:
  - Preview animations (150ms) for quick feedback
  - Commit animations (300ms) for smooth transitions
  - Revert animations (200ms) for quick cancellation
- **Field Collision Detection**: Prevents overlapping with smart positioning
- **Haptic Feedback**: Enhanced user experience with tactile responses
- **Clean Architecture**: Feature-based organization with data/domain/presentation layers
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite for preview system and collision detection
- **Logging System**: Structured logging with different categories
- **Theme Support**: Consistent theming across the application

### Technical Features
- **6-Column Grid Layout**: Supports 33%, 50%, 67%, and 100% field widths
- **Normalized Positioning**: Coordinate system independent of screen size
- **Multi-Strategy Placement**: Three different placement algorithms
- **Animation Reuse**: Efficient animation system with configurable curves
- **State Management**: Clean state handling for drag operations and previews

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- Architecture documentation (FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md)
- Preview system implementation details (PREVIEW_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md)
- Contributing guidelines

## [1.0.1] - 2025-03-09

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed
- **Production Builds**: Eliminated unwanted debug output in release builds
- **Console Cleanliness**: Clean, professional console output
- **Performance**: Reduced overhead from debug logging in production

### üîß Changed
- **Logger System**: Debug mode is now disabled by default (`_debugMode = false`) for cleaner production builds
- **Console Output**: Replaced `print()` statements with proper Logger calls
- **Internal Implementation**: Streamlined drag and drop logic by removing debug-specific code paths

### üóëÔ∏è Removed
- **Debug Print Statements**: Removed all `print()` statements from main application code
- **Verbose Debug Output**: Cleaned up extensive debug logging in preview system
- **Internal Debug Methods**: Removed debug-specific internal methods and state tracking

### ‚ú® Added
- **Production-Ready Logging**: Clean console output in production builds
- **Enhanced Error Reporting**: `Logger.error()` continues to work in production for proper error tracking

### üìã Optional Configuration

If you want to see debug output during development:

```dart
// Add this to your main() function
void main() {
  Logger.setDebugMode(true); // Enable debug logging for development
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
